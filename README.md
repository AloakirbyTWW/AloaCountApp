# AloaCountApp

Windows app where you have a counter that you can increment with buttons or global hotkeys
- You should be able to create, save, and delete different counter sessions
- Choose by how much to increment
- Select a global hotkey
- Display the counter as a number or as a time (example 2D 16H 37.190)
- Choose between 4 fonts and 3 sizes

I did this app quickly for myself to use it on streams without testing everything thoroughly.
I can't guarantee that it will work on all computers and that it won't crash.

# How to start

1) Download the file
  If you're on the Github page, there should be a green button called "Code" somewhere at the top of the page that, when clicked, makes an option to download a zip file appear.
  Download that zip file and unzip it.

2) Inside the "AloaCountApp" folder, there should be a "AloaCounterApp.exe - Racourci" file.
   Double click on that file to start the app. The app window should appear.
